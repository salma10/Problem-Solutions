/*
For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

           int[] result = new int[2];
           
           if(area <= 0)
             return new int[]{};
           
           int w = (int)(Math.Sqrt(area));
            
           while (area % w != 0)
           {
               w -= 1;
           }
        
           result[0] = area / w;
           result[1] = w;

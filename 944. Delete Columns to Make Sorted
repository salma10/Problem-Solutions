//Problem description
/*
You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.
The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:
abc
bce
cae
You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.
Return the number of columns that you will delete.

        for(int i = 0; i < strs[0].Length; i++)
        {
            char c = strs[0][i];
            for(int j = 1; j < strs.Length; j++)
            {
                if(c > strs[j][i])
                {
                    noOfDeletedCol++;
                    break;

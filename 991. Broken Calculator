//Problem description
/*
There is a broken calculator that has the integer startValue on its display initially. In one operation, you can:
multiply the number on display by 2, or
subtract 1 from the number on display.
Given two integers startValue and target, return the minimum number of operations needed to display target on the calculator.

    public int BrokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        while(target > startValue)
        {
            count++;
            if(target % 2 == 1)
                target++;
            else
                target /= 2;

//Problem description
/*
You are given a non-negative integer array nums. In one operation, you must:
Choose a positive integer x such that x is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in nums.
Subtract x from every positive element in nums.
Return the minimum number of operations to make every element in nums equal to 0.

//Problem description
/*
You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened on the same day, event1 and event2, where:
event1 = [startTime1, endTime1] and
event2 = [startTime2, endTime2].
Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of HH:MM.
A conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).
Return true if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return false.
*/
public class Solution {
    public bool HaveConflict(string[] event1, string[] event2) {
        double t11 = TimeSpan.Parse(event1[0]).TotalMinutes;
        double t12 = TimeSpan.Parse(event1[1]).TotalMinutes;
        double t21 = TimeSpan.Parse(event2[0]).TotalMinutes;
        double t22 = TimeSpan.Parse(event2[1]).TotalMinutes;
            
        return   (t11 <= t21 && t21 <= t12 ) ||
                (t21 <= t11 && t11 <= t22)

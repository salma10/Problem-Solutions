//Problem description
/*
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.
Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. 
It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

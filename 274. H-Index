//Problem description
/*
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, 
return compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
*/
//Time complexity - O(nlogn) Space - O(1)
public class Solution {
    public int HIndex(int[] citations) {
        Array.Sort(citations, (a, b) => b - a);
        int h = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < citations.Length; i++)
        {
            if(citations[i] >= i + 1)
                h = i + 1;
        }
        return h;
    }
